	<p>The scope value is {{name}}</p>

	<p> We are a small dynamic team of professionals brainstorming about how we can solve complex data and policy issues that plague humanity. Much of our efforts are rooted in science, mathamatics, engineering and policy in general. However, we are dynamic and can evolve our statagy to suit any industry.</p>

  <p>We are students of data and policy thus constantly toiling to reveal the hidden elusive patterns buried within various data sets thereby transforming said patterns into information. Through information discovery government, private industry, and NGOs can develop policy with surgical precision. Furthermore, like the continuous flow of data and information, we will never yield to complexity. To the contrary, we thrive on it!</p>

   <p>As writers of both words and code, our hope is that those combinations will begin to shed light on the enigmas of global politics and technology. </p>

   <h3>Mission</h3>
   <p>Our mission is provide expert research, analysis, soft and hard engineering services in the following fields of inquary:
    <ul>
      <li>Data Analysis and Visulaization</li>
      <li>Information Search and Retrieval</li>
      <li>Mobile Computing</li>
      <li>Distributed / Cloud Computing</li>
    </ul>
    so that our customers can capture the ebb and flow of data streaming through the web, and provide a viseral experiance of enlightenment to their audiences. Our commitment is to provide our customers with the power to apply sergical desion making capabilities through information intelligence.</p>

   <h3>Vision</h3>
   <p>Our vision is to see the natural world of computing enhance all of sciencia, and provide enlightenment to the international, socio-economic human world.</p>
