	<p>The scope value is {{name}}</p>

	<p> We are a small dynamic team of professionals brainstorming about how we can solve complex data and policy issues that plague humanity. Much of our efforts are rooted in science, mathamatics, engineering and policy in general. However, we are dynamic and can evolve our statagy to suit any industry.</p>

  <p>We are students of data and policy thus constantly toiling to reveal the hidden elusive patterns buried within various data sets thereby transforming said patterns into information. Through information discovery government, private industry, and NGOs can develop policy with surgical precision. Furthermore, like the continuous flow of data and information, we will never yield to complexity. To the contrary, we thrive on it!</p>

   <p>As writers of both words and code, our hope is that those combinations will begin to shed light on the enigmas of global politics and technology. </p>
